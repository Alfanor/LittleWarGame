# LittleWarGame
This is just a Little War Game without any ambition or even graphism.

## What do you need
Even if this is really simple to find what you need to run properly this project, this is a list of needed software :

1. Apache or Nginx server (or other maybe, I don't really care)
2. Mysql or MariaDB 
3. Doxygen
4. Graphivz (for Doxygen graphs)
5. MysqlWorkBench (to read the MPD if you want to see it)

## Generate the doxygen documentation
I think that you know how to do this, but if it's not the case, just run this command from the root directory of the project :

```sh
$ doxygen Doxyfile
```
